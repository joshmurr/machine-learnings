# A ~Boring~ Simple GAN

A simple GAN using Keras to generate a 3D vector from a 10D latent vector input. This is a scaled up version of [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-a-1-dimensional-function-from-scratch-in-keras/) which does the same but in 2D.
