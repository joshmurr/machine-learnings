# A Selection of iPython Notebooks on ML Stuff

To use the notebooks on Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Click on the __Github__ tab.
3. Paste the URL of the notebook (from Github) which will look something like this:
```
https://github.com/joshmurr/machine-learnings/blob/master/simple-gan/Simple_GAN_3D.ipynb
```
4. Click on the _magnifying glass_ (do not click 'New Notebook') and it will load.

You will most likely want to set the _Runtime_ to _GPU_ the most of the accelerated computation Colab provides for free.
